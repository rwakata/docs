With the Xente API, you can transfer funds to bank accounts in three easy steps.
## Step 1 - Verify bank account

To ensure your transfering money to the correct bank account, please first verify the person who will be receiving funds using this [endpoint](/api-reference/people/get)

## Step 2 - Post a bank transfer transaction

Once you verify that you are sending money to the correct person, post a mobile money transaction using this [endpoint](/api-reference/banktransfers/transactions/create)

## Step 3 - Receive Instant Payment Notification (IPN)

All transactions on Xente are asynchronous. Therefore, after you POST a bank transaction, you need to wait for a success (or failure) response using webhooks called Instant Payment Notifications (IPN).

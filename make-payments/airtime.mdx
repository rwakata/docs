With the Xente API, you can send airtime in three easy steps.
## Step 1 - Verify person

To ensure you are sending airtime to the correct beneficiary, please first verify the person who will be receiving airtime using this [endpoint](/api-reference/people/get)

## Step 2 - Post a airtime transaction

Once you verify that you are sending money to the correct person, post a airtime transaction using this [endpoint](/api-reference/airtime/transactions/create)

## Step 3 - Receive Instant Payment Notification (IPN)

All transactions on Xente are asynchronous. Therefore, after you POST a airtime transaction, you need to wait for a success (or failure) response using webhooks called Instant Payment Notifications (IPN).

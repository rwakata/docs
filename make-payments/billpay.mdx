With the Xente API, you can pay bills in three easy steps.
## Step 1 - Get bill details

Get the bill pay details including account details, balance etc and display them to your users using this [endpoint](/api-reference/people/get)

## Step 2 - Post a pay bill transaction 

Once you get the bill details, post a pay bill transaction using this [endpoint](/api-reference/bills/transactions/create)

## Step 3 - Receive Instant Payment Notification (IPN)

All transactions on Xente are asynchronous. Therefore, after you POST a pay bill transaction, you need to wait for a success (or failure) response using webhooks called Instant Payment Notifications (IPN).

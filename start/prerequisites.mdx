1. [Open a Xente account](https://app.xente.co/signup) to get started - it is FREE.
2. After opening an account, create an application. Anytime you want to interact with the Xente application you must create an application. You can learn more about applications [here](/start/apps).
3. Integrate mobile money, Visa cards, bank transfers, bill payments, and many other awesome features into your app using our API. It's simple and secure.

Before you begin developing with Xente, you need to complete the following steps:

1. Open a Xente account.
2. Verify your Xente account - Verification involves submitting Know Your Customer (KYC) details, which may include a certificate of incorporation, identification of directors, and any other relevant information to help us verify your business. 

If you are a developer working on behalf of a business, you can request the owner of the business to provide this information. 

Once your account is open and verified, you will receive API Keys that grant you access to transact with the Xente API.

Please note that we do not offer a sandbox account. You need to fulfill all the requirements for account opening before using Xente.

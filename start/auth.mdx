description: 'Authenticate and authorize all API calls'

Xente uses a token based authorization and authentication scheme. 

You will need to have 

1. An API Key -  To get an API Key first create an Application under your developer settings
2. User email and password - Every API call is made on behalf or a user so you need for first authenticate them 

** I actually need to understand this, but it is super important we authenticate both the application and the user. 

## Step 1. Authenticate user

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://api.xente.co/auth/login?
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
-X GET
```

```bash Node
const axios = require('axios');

const apiUrl = 'https://api.xente.co/cards?';

const options = {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
  }
};

axios.get(apiUrl, options)
  .then(response => {
    // Handle the response data here
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle any errors that occur
    console.error(error);
  });
```

</CodeGroup>

### Response message 

| Key          | Type      | Description
| --------     | -------   |-------------
| Token        | string    | Authentication token that you will use to authenticate subsquent API calls
| refreshToken | string    | The refresh token is used to refresh session without requiring new user login
| success      | boolean   | Status of authentication request
| message      | string    | A description of status 

** Do we need other parameters 

> Important information on the Token
>
>> 1. Send the token in the HTTP Authorization header with every request. 
>> 2. The lifetime of the token is 60 minutes. Once it expires, use the refresh token to obtain another one or have the user log in again. 
>> 3. The token will only be exposed once. Safely store it in the cache for the duration of its lifetime

## Step 2. Login into an account 

Once you have authenticated the user and have a valid Token, you can now login into an account using the API call below 

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://api/auth/accounts/{accountId}/login?
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
-X GET
```

```bash Node
const axios = require('axios');

const apiUrl = 'https://api.xente.co/cards?';

const options = {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
  }
};

axios.get(apiUrl, options)
  .then(response => {
    // Handle the response data here
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle any errors that occur
    console.error(error);
  });
```

</CodeGroup>

Get the account ID under settings. I think we also have this as configuration

** What I dont understand, do you need to have step 2, or if you have the account Id you can make subsquent calls ?

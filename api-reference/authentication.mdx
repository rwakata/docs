Xente implements a token-based authentication scheme to ensure secure access to its API. 

## Step 1 - Get your credentials 
Find your app Key, app Password and a user identifier under developer settings in the Xente portal 

## Step 2 - Authenticate
Send the folliwing JSON payload to the auehtnication endpoint api/auth/login
```json Response
{
  "appKey": "YOURAPPKEY",
  "appPassword": "YOURAPPPASSWORD",
  "userId": 1223232, // The userId is unique to each user and is typically provided during the registration process or assigned by your system.
  "includeRefreshToken": true // Setting this to true requests that a refresh token be included in the response for managing token expiration.
}
```

## Step 3 - Get Access Token 

Upon successful authentication, Xente responds with an access token and, if requested, a refresh token.

## Important 

1. The access token must be included in the HTTP Authorization header of each subsequent request to access the user's account and perform actions. The token should be prefixed with the scheme (typically "Bearer").
2. Tokens are exposed only on creation of application. For security reasons, store the token securely and appropriately manage its lifecycle, considering its 60-minute validity

The Xente API follows a RESTful architecture.

1. Our communication relies on standard GET, POST, and PUT requests, accompanied by HTTP response codes that indicate the status and any encountered errors.
2. JSON format is used for all response payloads, ensuring consistency and ease of integration.
3. When making API requests, please ensure that the Content-Type header is set to "application/json".
4. For authentication purposes, you will require an AppKey, AppPassword, and UserId, which you can obtain under Developer Settings in the Xente portal.

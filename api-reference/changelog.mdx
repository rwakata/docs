Xente uses token based authentication scheme

Once a user has logged in and received a token, They are required to complete the login process by logging into the account they wish to access. 

Each subsequent request should include the token in the HTTP Authorization header.

Token lifetime is 60min after creation. Once a token has expired, you can refresh it using the refresh token provided or a re-login is required in order to re-authenticate.

Xente’s tokens allow for a single user to have multiple active tokens on separate devices..

For security reasons Xente will only expose the token once, on login or on register, and never again. Be sure to store it somewhere safe for a period that is equal to its lifetime.

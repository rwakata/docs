<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You need a Pro+ account to create virtual Visa debit cards API
</Info>


With Xente, ordering physical Visa debit cards is a easy. Simply place your order through the Xente portal, and the cards will be delivered right to your location. 

Once you have the cards, you can easily assign them to your desired users.

Assigning users can be done effortlessly using the portal, or if you prefer, you can programmatically assign them through API calls.

To assign a card to a user, just make the API call provided below:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://api.xente.co/cards?
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
-X GET
```

```bash Node
const axios = require('axios');

const apiUrl = 'https://api.xente.co/cards?';

const options = {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
  }
};

axios.get(apiUrl, options)
  .then(response => {
    // Handle the response data here
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle any errors that occur
    console.error(error);
  });
```

</CodeGroup>

Once the card is assigned, the user will receive an email prompting them to set their PIN. Once they've set their PIN, they can start using the card right away.

With the Xente API, you can send mobile money in three easy steps.
## Step 1 - Verify mobile money number

To ensure your collecting money from the correct mobile money number, please first verify the person your collecting money from using this [endpoint](/api-reference/people/get)

## Step 2 - Post a mobile money collection transaction 

Once you verify that you are collecting money from the correct person, post a mobile money transaction using this [endpoint](/api-reference/mobilemoney/transactions/create)

## Step 3 - Receive Instant Payment Notification (IPN)

All transactions on Xente are asynchronous. Therefore, after you POST a mobile money transaction, you need to wait for a success (or failure) response using webhooks called Instant Payment Notifications (IPN).
